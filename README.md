Assignment: "Interactive Resume Builder with Advanced React Features"

Documentation:-

ยง Overview of your project.

-> In this project, we were supposed to build a dynamic resume generator using advanced react functions and hooks

ยง Tech Stack used.
-> ReactJS, React-to-print, Javascript, react-feather

ยง Explanation of key React concepts applied (e.g., State
Management, Hooks).
-> The state is formed and passed from the body to the Form and ResumePDF components, where the save option edits it

ยง Challenges you faced and how you solved them.
-> Active Class in form when we scroll form sections (was not adding strings then I realised on stack overflow content that we have to add class name as strings)

-> Passing react ref to ResumePDF, I learned about forwardRef and how we can use ref to print the document.
